# Avoiding common attacks.

   List of known and frequently used attacks.

 - Self destruct.
 - DelegateCall.
 - Re-Entrancy.
 - Overflow/underflow.
 - Accessing Private Data.
 - Source of randomness.
 - Denial-Of-Service.
 - Phising => tx.origin.
 - Front running.
 - Block TimeStamp manipulation by miners.
 - Signature Replay.

 ## Measures we took against possible vulnerabilities.

   1. We avoid Reentrancy by using the last version of solidity compiler 0.8.0 âœ…
   2. We overcame the potential issue of overFlow and underFlow by using the OpenZeppelin library Counters to increment our indexes. âœ…
```
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";

contract TokenERC721 is ERC721URIStorage {

  using Counters for Counters.Counter;
  Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;
  Counters.Counter private _offerIds;

  mapping(uint256 => uint256) prices;
  mapping(string => uint8) hashes;
  mapping(address => uint256) public ethBalance; 
  mapping(uint256 => uint256) public tokenPrice;
  
  constructor() ERC721("DigiboxToken", "DGBT") {}

  receive() external payable {}

  function setPrice(uint256 price) public returns (uint256) {
    _offerIds.increment();
    uint256 newOfferId = _offerIds.current();
    prices[newOfferId] = price;

    return newOfferId;
  } 
  ```
