# Avoiding common attacks.

   List of known and frequently used attacks.

 - Self destruct.
 - DelegateCall.
 - Re-Entrancy.
 - Overflow/underflow.
 - Accessing Private Data.
 - Source of randomness.
 - Denial-Of-Service.
 - Phising => tx.origin.
 - Front running.
 - Block TimeStamp manipulation by miners.
 - Signature Replay.

 ## Measures we took against possible vulnerabilities.

   1. We avoid Reentrancy by re-setting the current balance of the caller at the beggining of the function âœ…

  ```
    function reimbursement(uint256 tokenId) external payable {
        require(_isApprovedOrOwner(_msgSender(), tokenId), "ERC721: transfer caller is not owner nor approved");
        ethBalance[msg.sender] -= tokenPrice[tokenId]; âœ…
        _burn(tokenId); 

        (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{value: tokenPrice[tokenId]}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to withdraw");

        emit reimbursed(msg.sender, tokenPrice[tokenId]);
    }
  ```

   2. By using the library Counters given by OZ we sort of counter the problem of OverFlow and underFlow. âœ…
      We do not expect other problem with overFlow or underFlow in our smart contract.

```
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";

contract TokenERC721 is ERC721URIStorage {

  using Counters for Counters.Counter;
  Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;
  Counters.Counter private _offerIds;

   ....
   
  function setPrice(uint256 price) public returns (uint256) {
    _offerIds.increment();
    uint256 newOfferId = _offerIds.current();
    prices[newOfferId] = price;

    return newOfferId;
  } 
  ```
