# Avoiding common attacks.

   List of known and frequently used attacks.

 - Self destruct.
 - DelegateCall.
 - Re-Entrancy.
 - Overflow/underflow.
 - Accessing Private Data.
 - Source of randomness.
 - Denial-Of-Service.
 - Phising => tx.origin.
 - Malicious code from an external contract.
 - Front running.
 - Block TimeStamp manipulation by miners.
 - Signature Replay.

 ## Measures we took against possible vulnerabilities.

   1. We avoid Reentrancy by using the library non-Reentrant from OpenZeppelin âœ…
   2. We overcome this issue using the OpenZeppelin librarie Counters to increment our indexes.
       I.E :  
```import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";

contract TokenERC721 is ERC721URIStorage {

  using Counters for Counters.Counter;
  Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;
  Counters.Counter private _offerIds;

  mapping(uint256 => uint256) prices;
  mapping(string => uint8) hashes;
  mapping(address => uint256) public ethBalance; 
  mapping(uint256 => uint256) public tokenPrice;
  
  constructor() ERC721("DigiboxToken", "DGBT") {}

  receive() external payable {}

  function setPrice(uint256 price) public returns (uint256) {
    _offerIds.increment();
    uint256 newOfferId = _offerIds.current();
    prices[newOfferId] = price;

    return newOfferId;
  } ```


 ## Unecessary measures for this project.

   1. Self-destruct ðŸŸ¥
   2. DelegateCall ðŸŸ¥
   3.
